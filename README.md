# docker-task-dashboard-bpms-angular
An all in one docker container that deploys Red Hat BPM Suite with a custom angular js task dashboard onto one JBoss EAP instance. Each branch corresponds to the version of Red Hat BPM Suite in use.

Note: docker best practice would be to deploy these as two seperate containers, probably in their own kubernetes pods. This is example is more about demoing the APIs and showing the integration.
